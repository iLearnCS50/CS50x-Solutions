sort1 uses:bubble sort

How do you know?:this algorithm requies the maximum run-time in each case, mainly because it only compares one number at a time and runs through all the numbers to find the smallest one. the below data shows that it clearly requies the maximum run-time in comparison with other algorithms.
Time used;
on random5000: 0.061s
on random10000: 0.195s
on random50000: 5.966s




sort2 uses:merge sort

How do you know?:from the run time for randomly arranged data below, clearly this set has the lowest of all the run-time. so clearly, the most efficient one was merge sort, with the lowest number of steps required.
Time used;
on random5000: 0.037s
on random10000: 0.079s
on random50000: 1.637s




sort3 uses:selection sort

How do you know?:the second most efficint one,selection sort. this algorithm runs through the data each time to find the smallest and brings it back from where it started.
Time used;
on random5000: 0.048s
on random10000: 0.139s
on random50000: 3.525s
